Q1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Ans: If I am using more than one computers, or if there are more than one person working 
on the same project.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Ans: To prevent cluttering ,... and also to let us have the control and freedom...
Also to let other people do their own editing on their own versions of 
codes.
Thus, helping in collaborations and discussions...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

Ans: 
Fork : Basically copying a repository from account of one person to mine , in 
remote only.

Clone : Copy a repository from one directory to another (for example from 
remote to local directory)

Branch: Making a separate direction to save our present version... 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q4: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Ans: The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is that we can always do comparisons based on that state, whenever events like push or pull or anything else is required..

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q5: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What 
would be easier, and what would be harder?

Ans: Without Git or Github, the way of collaboration would be 
primitive one as edits to a file, comparing files, sending mails, 
manually screening and merging changes,etc...
For very small projects, primitive method would be easier, since 
git and github also involves somewhat steep learning curve..
But for large projects, and also in the long run, Git would be much
much easier, compared to maintianance and collaboration using 
primitive method.
