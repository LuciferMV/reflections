Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Ans: When we initialize a repository using git init, it becomes a git repository, capable of version control...
A new subdirectory called ".git" is created in it.
Now we can do all such operations as commits,etc.. on this.

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Ans: Working directory is just a directory with our files and all.
No special mechanisms of version control..
Repository is the version controlled system, of our files, having 
all necessary features to implement rollback and all..
Staging area is the intermediary, has the files to be added to the next commit our repository, from our present working directory.

The value it offers is that it provides us a stage for our present 
work, so that we can save it to next commit.
